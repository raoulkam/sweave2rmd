# Sweave2Rmd

Sweave2Rmd is a project to convert all [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org)
Sweave vignettes to Rmd.

See the project [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/nJHqzR1j/bioconductor-vignettes-rnw-rmd-project)
for vignettes that need converting and the [Github Project](https://github.com/orgs/Bioconductor/projects/2)
for the status of vignettes being converted. 

If you'd like to volunteer, see contribute.Rmd.

If you're a Bioconductor maintainer who needs help converting to `.Rmd`,
open an issue in your repository and ask `@Bioconductor/sweave2rmd` for
help converting.

This project follows the [Bioconductor Code of
Conduct](https://bioconductor.github.io/bioc_coc_multilingual/).
